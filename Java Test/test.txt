11. The Java compiler takes Java code and compiles to Java Byte code which is a cross-platform format. When we run Javaapplications, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) gets loaded in the memory. It takes our bytecode as the input and translatesit to thenative code for the underlying operating system. There are variousimplementations of Java Virtual Machine for almost all operating systems
